<center><p><b><i> Graduation, </p></b></i>
     <p>This photo was taken a month before our graduation. We took a photo </br>
     to remember our senior year and how stressful but great these days are. </br>
     We are unable to took a picture on the actual graduation since our school </br>
     held a virtual graduation only as a result of covid-19.</p></br></center>

<center><p><b><i> Build, </p></b></i>
<p>I took this picture when we are planting trees that are required in one of our subjects. </br>
It suddenly hits me as I realized that similar to a building, we need to accomplish </br>
different stages to complete, and skipping a step or accomplishing things </br>
improperly can sometimes backfire since the foundation was made in a hurry. </p></br></center>

<center><p><b><i> Memory,</p></b></i>
<p>This is a low quality picture of my pet dog but it became special </br>
     because it reminds us how long we been to.</p></br></center>
