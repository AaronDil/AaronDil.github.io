  <p>This photo was taken a month before our graduation. We took a photo </br>
  to remember our senior year and how stressful but great these days are. </br>
  We are unable to took a picture on the actual graduation since our school </br>
  held a virtual graduation only as a result of covid-19.</p></br>
