     <p><b><i> Build, </p></b></i>
     <p>I took this picture when we are planting trees that are required in one of our subjects. </br>
     It suddenly hits me as I realized that similar to a building, we need to accomplish </br>
     different stages to complete, and skipping a step or accomplishing things improperly </br>
     can sometimes backfire since the foundation was made in a hurry. </p></br>

     <p><b><i> Time, </p></b></i>
      <p>I admit that I am a lazy person. Even I know that time is relevant but always forget </br>
         how to spend it wisely. A watch for me is a reminder that time passed so quickly</br>
         so that we should spend it wisely.</p></br>

     <p><b><i> Memory,</p></b></i>
      <p>For me, we tend to forget and we can't always remember everything.</br>
         I always take a picture or a video of those happy moments to have a </br>
         memory or remembrance of that moment. Even if I forget it someday, </br>
         I can relive the memories once I saw it..</p></br>
